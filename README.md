# How Languages Divide Colors: Color Naming Models and Translation

This repository contains supplement material of [the paper](TODO) including:
- Color-name judgements that are collected from LabIntheWild
- Color naming probabilistic models for _hue colors_ and _full colors_
- Interactive visualizations
  - [The probabilities of terms for each hue color bin across 14 languages](https://uwdata.github.io/color-naming-in-different-languages/vis/color-composition-figure.html)
  - [Interactive version of the above](https://uwdata.github.io/color-naming-in-different-languages/vis/stacked-spectrum.html)
  - [Maximum Probability Maps for English and Korean color names](https://uwdata.github.io/color-naming-in-different-languages/vis/full_color_maps.html)
  - [Comparison of translations](https://uwdata.github.io/color-naming-in-different-languages/vis/translation.html)
  - [The probabilities of viridis colors for some nameable terms](https://uwdata.github.io/color-naming-in-different-languages/vis/viridis.html)

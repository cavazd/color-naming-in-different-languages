<h1>The Many Languages, Many Colors Project</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Different languages divide the color spectrum in different ways, which has been shown to influence how people perceive color. The Many Languages, Many Colors project is an attempt to measure these differences by collecting data and creating color models, and then share the results through visualizations and publicly released data sets. But first... </p>

<h2>Take the Survey!</h2>
<p>Before you look at what we found, please consider taking our 12 minute <a href="http://labinthewild.org/studies/color_perception/">color perception survey</a>. We could always use more data, and reading this post first might influence your answers.</p>

<h2>Visualizations</h2>
<p>We have created a number of different visualizations to share our results:</p>
